        <h3>Input: I was supposed to start writing the paper at 5:00 PM. But then I
          started playing with this cool new language model for 10 minutes. 10
          minutes later, it's suddenly 9:30 PM!</h3>
        <h3>
          Model Output: This joke is about how time flies when you're having fun.
          The person was supposed to start writing a paper at 5:00 PM, but they
          started playing with a language model instead. They thought they were
          only playing with it for 10 minutes, but it was actually 4.5 hours.</h3>

        <h3>Input: What's the difference between a zebra and an umbrella? One is a striped animal related to horses, 
          another is a device you use to stop the rain from falling on you.</h3>

  
        <h3>
          Model Output: This joke is an anti-joke. The joke is that the answer is obvious, 
          and the joke is that you were expecting a funny answer.</h3>
